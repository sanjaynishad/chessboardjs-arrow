# chessboardjs-arrow
A lightweight utility for drawing arrows on [Chessboard.js](https://chessboardjs.com/) boards. Enhance your visualizations with custom annotationsâ€”great for tutorials, analysis tools, and interactive demos.  I originally created this a few years back as a small helper tool, and I'm now sharing it publicly for others who might find it useful.
